				</div>
				<h3 class = 'faqHeading'>When should Manos Construction become involved in our project?</h3>
					<div>
						<p>In general we find it beneficial for the customer if we are involved as early as is practical in the&nbsp;project. Besides building rapport between members of the project team, our technical assistance and&nbsp;willingness to estimate various options for our clients helps insure you get a top quality job within&nbsp;your budget.</p>
					</div>
				<h3 class = 'faqHeading'>How does Manos Construction financially manage a project?</h3>
					<div>
						<p>We use three main tools: estimates, job budgets, and change orders.</p>
						<p>We start with a detailed&nbsp;<em><strong>estimate</strong></em>, which many architects have described as being among the most&nbsp;thorough they have seen.</p>
						<p>Next a<strong><em>&nbsp;job budget&nbsp;</em></strong>is created, which breaks the costs of a project into many different categories.</p>
						<p>As a job progresses, costs are compared to this budget on a weekly basis.</p>
						<p>Whenever there is a change in the scope of the work, a&nbsp;<strong><em>change order&nbsp;</em></strong>is created for the customer’s review.</p>
						<p>These measures as well as our expertise in building have resulted in our reputation, as stated by&nbsp;many customers, of being “good custodians of their money.” We are proud of the fact that, in more&nbsp;than 18 years of business, we have a fine record of accuracy in the estimating of project costs.</p>
					</div>
				<h3 class = 'faqHeading'>What should we know about the way Manos Construction runs its projects?</h3>
					<div>
						<p><strong>Scheduling:&nbsp;</strong>We take great pride in our reputation of keeping our projects moving and on track. &nbsp;Our foremen have a great deal of experience in construction project management and are constantly&nbsp;anticipating future needs on a timely basis.</p>
						<p><strong>Quality Control:&nbsp;</strong>We have experienced minimal turnover of personnel during the years we&nbsp;have been in business. In this regard, we are unusual in our industry. This continuity helps give our clients&nbsp;a finished product that maintains the highest standards. Due to our extensive experience, we have the&nbsp;ability to manage all elements of your project, including construction, site work, landscaping, etc. &nbsp;Our subcontractors are specialists in remodeling as well as new construction. We have had a fine&nbsp;working relationship with most of them for many years, and we are often complimented on their work&nbsp;as well as their demeanor on our jobs.</p>
						<p><strong>Flexibility:&nbsp;</strong>Building, with its inherent suprises and unknowns, demands flexibility. We have&nbsp;enjoyed excellent rapport with the clients, architects and designers with whom we have worked. This&nbsp;is due in large part to our ability to listen and make constructive recommendations, while understanding&nbsp;and respecting the points of view of others. Many people have said “Manos Construction is easy to work&nbsp;with.”</p>
